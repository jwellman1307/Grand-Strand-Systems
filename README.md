I ensure that my code was functional by following best practices. I regularly tested my code often when I was writing new code. I use tools like junit and coverage test help me identify areas in the code that did not make logical sense. I also updated and improved my code often. To interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program, I would start by gathering requirements from different sources. Once all the requirements have been acquired, I would then create a program that would meet those needs. I would involve users throughout the development lifecycle to ensure that the program that I am creating is still meeting user requirements. When approaching a software design, it is important to start with a clear understanding of the problem that is trying to be solved. The three major components for me will be a design that is easy to use, scalable, and maintanable. Along with this and best practices I believe that I can create a hight functional program.
