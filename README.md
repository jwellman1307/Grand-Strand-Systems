# Grand-Strand-Systems

I ensured that my code was functional by following best practices and regularly testing the code as the project expanded. I used tools like junit and coverage test help me identify areas in the code that did not make logical sense. To interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program, one would start by gathering requirements from different sources. Once all the requirements have been acquired, we would then create a program that would meet those needs. I would involve users throughout the development lifecycle to ensure that the program that the team is creating is still meeting user requirements. With this approach, the team can get continued insight from the user allowing clear communication on desired results. When approaching a software design, it is important to start with a clear understanding of the problem that is trying to be solved. The three major components for me will be a design that is easy to use, scalable, and maintanable. Along with this and best practices I believe that I can create a hight functional program.
